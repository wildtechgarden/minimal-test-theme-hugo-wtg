[Daniel F. Dickinson](https://github.com/danielfdickinson), uses this theme for demo/test sites for the modules on which he works. For a repository for creating minimal reproducible test cases see either [the v0.3 branch of this repository](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/minimal-test-theme-hugo-dfd/tree/v0.3) or [hugo-testing by jmooring from the Hugo forums](https://github.com/jmooring/hugo-testing). That use case was previously a goal of this repository, but such is no longer the case.

See [license](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/minimal-test-theme-hugo-dfd/blob/master/LICENSE) for permissions on use.
