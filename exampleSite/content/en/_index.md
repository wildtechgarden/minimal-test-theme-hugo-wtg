[Wild Tech 'Garden'](https://www.wildtechgarden.ca/about/) uses this theme for
demo/test sites for the modules on which he works. For a repository for creating
minimal reproducible test cases see either [the v0.3 branch of this
repository](https://github.com/wildtechgarden/minimal-test-theme-hugo-wtg/tree/v0.3)
or [hugo-testing by jmooring from the Hugo
forums](https://github.com/jmooring/hugo-testing). That use case was previously
a goal of this repository, but such is no longer the case.

See [README](/doc/minimal-theme/readme/) for more information, and
[LICENSE](/doc/minimal-theme/LICENSE) for permissions on use.
